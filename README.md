# nbdev template

Use this template to more easily create your [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) project.

_If you are using an older version of this template, and want to upgrade to the theme-based version, see [this helper script](https://gist.github.com/hamelsmu/977e82a23dcd8dcff9058079cb4a8f18) (more explanation of what this means is contained in the link to the script)_.

## Troubleshooting Tips

-  Make sure you are using the latest version of nbdev with `pip install -U nbdev`
-  If you are using an older version of this template, see the instructions above on how to upgrade your template. 
-  It is important for you to spell the name of your user and repo correctly in `settings.ini` or the website will not have the correct address from which to source assets like CSS for your site.  When in doubt, you can open your browser's developer console and see if there are any errors related to fetching assets for your website due to an incorrect URL generated by misspelled values from `settings.ini`.
-  If you change the name of your repo, you have to make the appropriate changes in `settings.ini`
-  After you make changes to `settings.ini`, run `nbdev_build_lib && nbdev_clean_nbs && nbdev_build_docs` to make sure all changes are propagated appropriately.

## Changes in `setting.ini`

- Set lib_name and requirements in settings.ini
- Create symbolic link: ln -s /wd/project_name /wd/nbs/
- Install requirements: pip install $(cat settings.ini | grep -o "requirements =.*" | cut -f3- -d' ')
